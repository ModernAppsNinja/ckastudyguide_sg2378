### A Few Notes about the exam

- Currently (dec 2020) the exam is based on Kubernetes version 1.19. Please take this into consideration when working with the different study material, a lot of it might use an earlier version. The goal is to align the exam environment with the current Kubernetes minor version 4-8 weeks after release date so be sure to check what version is used when sitting the exam.
- The exam is lab/performance based and consist of different tasks/problems to be solved on the command line running on Linux
- There's 15-20 tasks that needs to be solved in 2 hours
- The exam is done online and you can take it from anywhere you'd like as long as your location meets the requirements
- Available resources during the exam is documents provided in the lab machine and ONE additional browser tab which can be used to access resources at https://kubernetes.io/docs/, https://github.com/kubernetes/, https://kubernetes.io/blog/
- The exam environment consists of six different Kubernetes clusters, all with one master and a different number of workers. There's also different CNIs in use so this is something to be aware of in your studying.
